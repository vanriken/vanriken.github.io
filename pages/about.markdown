My name is Alexandros Rikos and I am a software developer. Welcome to my personal website.

**My education:** After growing up in Greece, I moved to the Netherlands to study at Eindhoven University of Technology. There I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering, with a specialization in machine learning and signal processing.

**My interests:** I have a big interest in languages and cultures. I speak Greek, Dutch, English, German and Spanish. When it comes to sports, tennis is my big passion. I enjoy hiking in nature and riding my gravel bike. I like learning new things by working on personal programming and electronics projects.

Some random facts about me:
* I can do some impressive diabolo tricks, with a high probability of success.
* My favorite podcast is [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/). 


Through this website I want to share things that interest me and that may be useful to others.
